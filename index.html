    <p> Exploring The Benefits Of Decline Bench Training: A Jack City Guide
Authored by Audrey on April 16, 2021
Is the decline bench effective? Absolutely—if you know what’s what. Does decline bench work different muscles? Definitely—but it’s crucial to learn the right decline bench press technique. Practice your decline bench skills and more at Jack City Fitness, your home for health in Boise, Idaho.

Decline Bench Press: Benefits Galore!
Sure, you’ve probably heard of a bench press—you’ve probably even mastered it. But how many athletes have heard of the decline bench press? The popular form of chest exercise enters another level when performed on an angle, allowing for even better results and strength!

There are several decline bench press benefits for athletes to consider when building their chest routines. We highly recommend this form of workout, and at Jack City Fitness, we have all the equipment you need to practice it in a professional environment on your own, with a coach, or with your favorite gym buddy!

What Is A Decline Bench Press?
Before we dive into the benefits of decline bench training, let’s cover the basics. A decline bench press is very similar to the bench press you know and love. However, there is one major difference: a decline bench press is positioned on an angle—usually set between 15 and 30 degrees. This angle places the athlete’s upper body into a descent. By utilizing this position, rather than a straight angle, the lower pectoral muscles get an even better workout. Athletes who regularly use a decline bench press report even more defined pectoral muscles than they had from a straight bench press!

Benefits Of Decline Bench Training
There are several benefits of decline bench training. Some of them include:

It’ll Give Your Lower Pecs an Incredible Workout
One of the most talked-about benefits of decline bench training is the effective workout it provides your lower pecs. Although a regular incline or flat bench press will also give you a substantial chest workout, the decline version specifically activates your lower pectoral muscles, allowing for a more targeted lift. Rippling pecs, anyone?
It’s Easy on the Back and Shoulders
Lifting can do a number on your back and shoulders, especially if you struggle to maintain a safe arch during workouts. The unique decline angle of this bench press can put less strain on these body parts. This is essential information for athletes grappling with old injuries in these areas.
It Activates Your Triceps
Chest day and arm day in one lift? You bet. The decline bench press doesn’t only exercise pectoral muscles; it activates the triceps, too. Although athletes hoping to target their triceps should probably go for a more arm-specific move (like close-grip bench presses), the decline press is a great way to activate those muscles while focusing on the chest.
It’s a Strengthening Superpower
The unique position of the decline bench press allows for athletes to lift heavier weights than they would otherwise. This, of course, contributes to overall strength and better results—how can you refuse?
So, Are There Drawbacks To This Workout?
The main “downside” to decline bench press training is that it takes some getting used to. The 15-30-degree angle required is not the most comfortable position you’ll ever sit in, and it might feel awkward at first. That’s why we recommend that you try this workout for the first time with a fitness coach. They’ll be able to assure you that you’re in the right position, spot your reps, and help you get accustomed to this unique fitness routine.

What Muscles Does A Decline Bench Press Work?
The decline bench press activates several muscles. The main muscles worked out in a decline bench press are:

Pectoralis Major
This muscle in your upper chest includes both the lower and upper parts of the area. This is one of the elements which makes the decline bench press so unique—the entire pectoralis major gets a workout here, even the oft-neglected sternal head, or lower muscle group.
There are three major actions associated with the pectoralis major, all of which will be easier to perform once this muscle has strengthened. These actions are flexion, adduction, and medial rotation of the humerus. Flexion refers to actions like rolling a bowling ball or picking up a toddler. Adduction refers to flapping arm movement, like waving. Finally, medial rotation refers to flexed movements at a 90-degree angle, like a classic arm-wrestling sesh.

Triceps Brachii
This muscle is at the back of each of your upper arms. One of their primary purposes is to extend the forearms. This action is frequently utilized in both athletic and daily movements, so it’s an important one to strengthen!
Anterior Deltoid
The anterior deltoids are at the front of your shoulders. They are a crucial muscle group for athletes to hone, and many people find that conditioning and activating this area allows for them to exert less energy and avoid injury in their daily life as well.
A stronger set of anterior deltoids will bring your training to the next level! By working these muscles and strengthening your shoulders, you will soon lift heavier weights and train with less risk of injury. Plus, you’ll look amazing.

Biceps Brachii
These muscles are at the front of each of your upper arms and are often thought of as the pinnacle of a strong lifting game. Although Popeye made us think these muscles were born from tins of spinach, we know the truth: bench presses are the way to bulging biceps!
Strong biceps will make heavy lifting and pulling much easier, both in daily life and at the gym. Whether you’re doing yard work, carrying a screaming baby around the house, or beating your own record at the gym, you can thank your strong biceps for making it possible without pain.

What’s The Best Use Of A Decline Bench Press?
Most athletes incorporate a decline bench press into their workout routine to hone and build their pectoral muscles. While some may choose to bring this into a pre-existing routine, others might dedicate entire gym sessions to this technique.

In our opinion, the best use of a decline bench press is with a professional. As we discussed earlier, the unique angle required to perform this workout properly can feel awkward for beginners. By working with a trained professional, newcomers to this move can rest assured that they are holding the position correctly and not damaging their bodies.
